# Cursor Rules for Rella Analytics Project

*(This file captures project-specific patterns, preferences, and intelligence learned during development.)*

## Key Learnings & Patterns

*   **Data Granularity is Critical:** The initial `Product Sales.csv` lacks timestamps and transaction IDs, preventing meaningful time series forecasting and association rule mining. Aggregate data is insufficient for these predictive tasks. (See `memory-bank/data_requirements.md`).
*   **Simulated Data:** Time series forecasting on simulated dates (derived from aggregate data) produces artificial results and should only be used for illustration, clearly marking its limitations.

## User Preferences

*   Prioritizes seeing illustrative examples (even simulated ones) to demonstrate concepts to stakeholders.
*   Prefers Python/Flask for backend, React for frontend.
*   Wants AI (Cursor) to select appropriate initial ML algorithms.

## Project Intelligence

*   Initial data exploration completed.
*   Basic backend/frontend/documentation structure established.
*   Database schema designed, API endpoints defined.

## Tool Usage

*   Use `docker compose` (space, not hyphen) for Docker orchestration if available.
*   Use temporary Python scripts (`_temp_*.py`) for complex analysis execution via terminal, then delete them.
