# System Patterns: Rella Analytics Platform

## 1. Architecture Overview

*   **Pattern:** API-Driven Web Application
*   **Description:** A React frontend communicates with a Python/Flask backend via RESTful APIs. The backend handles business logic, data processing, interaction with the PostgreSQL database, and execution of ML models.
*   **Deployment:** Both frontend and backend applications will be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions (Initial)

*   **Backend Framework:** Flask (chosen for simplicity and flexibility for API development).
*   **Frontend Framework:** React (chosen for component-based UI and ecosystem).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (chosen for relational integrity and features).
*   **Containerization:** Docker (chosen for environment consistency and deployment).

## 3. Predictive Modeling Integration

*   **Initial Algorithms:**
    *   Time Series Forecasting (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA via Statsmodels) for sales/demand prediction.
    *   Association Rule Mining (e.g., Apriori via Scikit-learn or mlxtend) for identifying product co-purchase patterns.
*   **Integration:** Models will likely be trained offline/periodically. The backend API will either load pre-trained models to make predictions on demand or trigger model execution and retrieve results.

## 4. Component Relationships (High-Level)
