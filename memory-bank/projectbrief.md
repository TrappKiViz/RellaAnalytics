# Project Brief: Rella Analytics Platform

## 1. Overview

Develop an analytics platform initially for Rella Aesthetics, a med spa with locations in Napa and Vacaville. The long-term goal is to offer this platform as a Dockerized, cloud-deployable SaaS product for other med spas on a monthly subscription basis.

## 2. Core Functionality

The platform will provide a comprehensive analytics dashboard featuring:

*   **Data Filtering:** Ability to filter data by location (Napa vs. Vacaville initially).
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   Expenses (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
    *   Net Sales (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
    *   Expenses per Treatment Category
    *   Net Sales per Treatment Category
    *   Service Revenue & Typical Expenses Comparison
    *   Revenue Growth vs. Prior Period
    *   Average % Service Tool Utilization
    *   Revenue per Employee (Total & Average)
    *   % Bookings per Employee
    *   Average Transaction Value (Overall & By Products)
*   **Visualizations:** A variety of chart types including:
    *   Bar charts
    *   Line charts
    *   Combined Line-Bar charts
    *   Pie charts
    *   Donut charts
    *   Data Tables
    *   Heat Maps
    *   Single Value Displays
    *   File Gauges
    *   Geospatial Maps (for location/demographic data)

## 3. Predictive Modeling & AI Insights

Beyond dashboarding, the platform must incorporate AI/ML models to provide actionable business insights, trained on the spa's data. Key areas for prediction and analysis include:

*   **Market Expansion:** Identify promising new locations for business.
*   **Investment Guidance:** Suggest areas for strategic investment.
*   **Market Analysis:** Define current valuable markets.
*   **Growth Definition:** Develop models to understand and predict business growth.
*   **Product/Service Performance:** Identify underperforming products or services.
*   **Sales Forecasting:** Predict future sales trends.
*   **Customer Behavior:** Analyze purchasing patterns (e.g., products bought together).

## 4. Technical Requirements

*   **Deployment:** Fully Dockerized application.
*   **Environment:** Cloud-deployable (specific provider TBD - AWS/GCP/Azure).
*   **Architecture:** Scalable architecture suitable for a SaaS offering.

## 5. Business Model (Future)

*   **Target Audience:** Other med spas.
*   **Offering:** Software as a Service (SaaS).
*   **Pricing:** Monthly subscription.
