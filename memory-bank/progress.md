# Progress

## What Works

*   Initial project setup and documentation structure created.
*   Core documentation files populated (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).
*   Initial sales data (`Product Sales.csv`) identified and structure analyzed.
*   Data requirements for advanced analytics documented (`data_requirements.md`).
*   Basic analysis of `Product Sales.csv` performed.
*   Time series simulation performed (demonstrated failure due to data limitations).
*   Basic backend structure created (`backend/app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`).
*   Initial database schema designed (`database_schema.md`).
*   Initial API endpoints defined (`api_endpoints.md`).
*   Basic frontend structure created (Vite React project, src folders).
*   Utility API endpoints (`/locations`, etc.) implemented with mock data in `backend/app.py`.
*   Basic frontend layout components (`Layout`, `Header`, `Sidebar`) created.
*   Placeholder `DashboardPage` created.
*   Basic frontend routing configured.
*   Placeholder dashboard components created (`KPI_Card`, `SalesTrendChart`, `CategorySalesPieChart`, `TopItemsTable`).
*   `DashboardPage` uses placeholder components.
*   `DashboardPage` fetches data from mock backend API endpoints via `services/api.js`.
*   `recharts` library installed.
*   `SalesTrendChart` and `CategorySalesPieChart` use `recharts` for basic display.
*   Sales chart has custom tooltip.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Docker/DB Setup:** Resolve Docker issues, start DB container, implement schema.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Obtain granular data with timestamps and transaction IDs.
*   **Backend:** Functional API endpoint implementations, database connection & ORM setup, ML model integration.
*   **Database:** Setup PostgreSQL instance, implement schema (migrations).
*   **Frontend:** Specific UI components (charts, tables, filters), page layouts, state management, API service integration, connection to backend.
*   **ML Models:** Implementation and validation (blocked by data & DB setup).
*   **Deployment:** Refine Docker configs (multi-stage builds?), setup cloud environment (DB, servers), CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Status

*   Project scaffolding (backend, frontend, docs) largely complete.
*   Design phase for DB schema and API endpoints done.
*   **Blocked:** Advanced predictive modeling and related API endpoints due to lack of required data granularity.
*   Ready for specific frontend component development and more complex backend endpoint mocking.
*   Implementing basic frontend dashboard UI with placeholder components.
*   **Blocked:** Database setup and any DB-dependent tasks due to Docker issues.
*   **Blocked:** Advanced predictive modeling due to data granularity.
*   Ready for frontend API connection (to mock data) and charting library integration.
*   Basic frontend dashboard UI implemented with mock data and basic charts.
*   Ready for chart refinement, more UI components, and more complex backend endpoint mocking.

## Known Issues

*   Docker environment/authentication issues on local machine preventing DB container start.
*   `Product Sales.csv` lacks necessary granularity for predictive modeling.
*   Backend API endpoints currently use mock data; many endpoints unimplemented.
*   Frontend uses mock data for charts/tables; requires real backend endpoints.
*   Frontend charts need further refinement.
*   Database is not yet running or implemented.
